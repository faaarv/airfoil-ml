# airfoil-ml
A machine learning surrogate model trained on XFOIL-generated aerodynamic data to predict lift, drag, moment coefficients, and surface pressure distributions for airfoil geometries.

## The Data preprocessing: 

- Reduced raw dataset from 1.5 GB to 500 MB by filtering and cleaning JSON files considering relevance and efficiency
- Performed analysis on data using min-max, deviation, skewness, correlation, ... 
- Choosing the scaling method based on this informayion
- perform scaling, splitting and saving the scalers and index of splits
- 
The original dataset was restructured for this task, the dataset prepration can be found in data_preprocessing.

Unprocessed dataset can be found at https://nasa-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/plot3d_utilities/airfoil-learning-dataset.zip This dataset is not normalized and contains the geometry of each airfoil and the xfoil results(originally referenced in the [airfoil-learning](https://github.com/nasa/airfoil-learning)).

A critical insight during the process was the need to prevent "geometry leakage." Since the dataset contains multiple configuration for the same airfoil, a simple random train-test split could leak information. So **`GroupShuffleSplit`** from scikit-learn is used. This technique groups all data points belonging to a single airfoil geometry and ensures that the entire group is placed in a split (train or test or validation set). This provides a much more honest evaluation of the model's ability to predict the performance of **truly unseen airfoil geometries**.


## Model Development and Validation:
- Train a MLP on data (perform k-fold validation and optimizing metrics (MSE, R², training time): done in previous version )
- Achieved good performance on validation split and also on truly unseen airfoil configurations (different geometry input is interpolated to match the model feature)
- 
To identify the optimal Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, experimentation with key hyperparameters was done, including:
*   **Learning Rate:** Testing various schedules and optimizers to find a stable and efficient convergence.
*   **Hidden Layers and Neurons:** Evaluating different network depths and widths to balance model complexity with its ability to generalize.
*   **Regularization:** Applying techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

**Multi-Output Predictive Model:**
The trained model is capable of predicting :
 **The Pressure Coefficient (Cp) distribution** across the airfoil's surface.
*  **Four key aerodynamic coefficients**: Lift (CL), Drag (CD), pressure drag (Cdp), and Pitching Moment (CM).

## Results and Visualization
- Plots comparing XFOIL vs ML predictions on identical test cases, demonstrating strong predictive agreement:

- Reducing time comparing to Xfoil with preserved accuracy on unseen geometries, confirming model generalizability.

- The final model is tested on a completely unseen airfoil geometries. Its predictions compared to data generated by XFOIL is shown below. The results demonstrated a strong performance, with the model accurately capturing the detailed shape of the Cp distribution. This confirms the model's potential as a fast, surrogate for XFOIL in preliminary design workflows.

## Ongoing Work
- Currently refactoring prediction head for pressure-only output to enable fine-tuning or correction models with high resolution Dataset from [link].
- For this purpose : new repo [airfoil-ml-cm](https://github.com/faaarv/airfoil-ml-cm)
