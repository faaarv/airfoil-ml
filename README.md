# airfoil-ml
A machine learning surrogate model trained on XFOIL-generated aerodynamic data to predict lift, drag, moment coefficients, and surface pressure distributions for arbitrary airfoil geometries.

Unprocessed dataset can be found at https://nasa-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/plot3d_utilities/airfoil-learning-dataset.zip This dataset is not normalized and contains the geometry of each airfoil and the xfoil results.
